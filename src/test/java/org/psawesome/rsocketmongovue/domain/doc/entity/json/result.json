          "body_text": "Pyongyang, January 1 (KCNA) -- Newspapers Rodong Sinmun, Josoninmingun and Chongnyonjonwi today published a joint editorial \"Let Us Fully Demonstrate the Dignity and Might of the DPRK Under the Great Banner of Army-Based Policy\" on the occasion of the New Year, Juche 92 (2003). Last year, Juche 91 (2002), was a year of historic victory during which the dignity and might of Juche Korea were fully demonstrated in all domains of the revolution and construction, the editorial says, and goes on: Last year was a year of unity and grand political festivals which clearly bore witness to the politico-ideological might of our revolutionary ranks. Our army and people grandly commemorated the 90th birth anniversary of President Kim Il Sung and the 70th anniversary of the heroic Korean People's Army amidst the jubilation of the whole nation. The grand political events of the significant year, 2002, were the revolutionary festivals that fully demonstrated the Korean people's national honor of being blessed with the illustrious leaders generation after generation. They also demonstrated the iron faith and will of our army and people to carry forward the revolutionary traditions of Mt. Paektu forever. In the course of the hard struggle the great traits of the perfect unity were displayed. The leader of the revolution and all the servicepersons and people breathed the same breath and shared the idea and destiny. No nuclear weapons can break our single hearted unity whereby the leader trusts the army and people and they absolutely worship and follow their leader. Last year was a proud year during which the authority and might of the DPRK were fully displayed. It was thanks to the correct foreign policy of our party and its dynamic activities that a favorable phase was opened for the building of a powerful nation and spectacular events took place drawing the attention of the world. The imperialist arbitrary and high-handed practices that struck the whole world with terror could not frighten us nor block our advance. Last year was a year of changes during which a new leaping advance was made in the building of a powerful nation. Our people pushed ahead with a bold struggle to mark the greatest holidays of the nation with proud achievements gained in the building of an economically strong country. With the torch of Ranam lit throughout the country a breakthrough was made to bring about a new economic surge and grand nature-harnessing projects including the land leveling and rezoning in South Hwanghae Province and the Kaechon-Lake Thaesong Waterway Project were carried out successfully. New measures were taken to improve economic management and improve the standard of the people's living as required by the developing reality. It is a precious success registered in giving full play to the advantages of our-style socialism that a broad avenue was paved for the sustainable growth of our economy. It is the fixed faith enshrined by our people while pulling through the ordeals that our leader, ideology, army and system are best and it is the most just way to build a powerful socialist nation. All the victories won by our army and people in carrying out the cause of socialism last year are valuable fruition of leader Kim Jong Il's army-based line and his dynamic guidance. The New Year, Juche 92 (2003), is a year of bold offensive and great change when a general advance should be made toward the high peak of building a powerful nation under the banner of the army-based policy, the editorial says, and goes on: This year is a meaningful year which marks the 55th birthday of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, our glorious motherland. To celebrate this anniversary with splendour is an important political work to firmly preserve the exploits performed by President Kim Il Sung, father of socialist Korea, for state building and eternally glorify the revolutionary achievements gained at the cost of blood. It is also a worthwhile patriotic work to encourage the entire party and army and all the people to win fresh victory and display the might of our country, our motherland. This year's drive to brilliantly adorn the 55th birthday of the DPRK is a worthwhile struggle to comprehensively apply the Juche-based idea and line of giving top priority to the army in all fields of politics, the economy and culture. We should vigorously step up the general onward movement for the building of a powerful nation under the slogan \"Let Us Achieve a Great Victory with the Might of the Army-Based Policy Yhis Year, Which Marks the 55th Birthday of the DPRK\". In order to increase the might of the DPRK, it is important to consolidate the single hearted unity of the party, the army and the people based on the idea of giving top priority to the army as firm as a rock. Our party's revolutionary idea of giving top priority to the army is the most steadfast idea of independence against imperialism. We should cement the ideological position and class position of socialism as an iron-wall, fully determined to fight against imperialism to the last. We should also heighten the revolutionary vigilance against the imperialists' ideological and cultural poisoning and firmly preserve our ideology, morality and our noble socialist way of life. If the DPRK's might is to be fully demonstrated under the banner of the army-based policy, it is necessary to bring about a fresh change in the economic and cultural construction. It is the fixed will of our party to radically change the appearance of the country and enable the people to live as happily as others in a few years to come. We should put into practice in all aspects leader Kim Jong Il's grand plan for the building of a prosperous and powerful nation, confident of the future of the DPRK. Proceeding from the fundamental interests of the revolution, we should attach importance to the defence industry and direct primary efforts to it. Efforts should be made to effect fresh innovation in power, coal and metal industries and railway transport, considering these fields as a main link in the efforts to revitalize the national economy. The modernization of light industry should be accelerated to increase the production of quality consumer goods. In agriculture, the party's policies of bringing about a radical change in seed selection and potato farming and ensuring double cropping should be strictly implemented to significantly increase the agricultural production. It is also important to steadily push ahead with large-scale land realignment projects and build Pyongyang, the capital city of revolution, more magnificently and beautifully to meet the need of the new century. In order to effect a great surge in socialist economic construction, it is urgent to improve the economic management and rapidly develop science and technology. We should manage and operate the economy in such a way as to ensure the largest profitability while firmly adhering to the socialist principles. It is essential to acquire advanced technology in earnest and actively introduce ultra-modern science and technology as required by the it era. If the DPRK's dignity and sovereignty are to be firmly defended, it is important to strengthen our revolutionary armed forces in every way and decisively enhance their militant might and role. All the officers and men of the people's army should get ready to strike and wipe out any formidable enemy our own way by thoroughly implementing the training-first slogan. They should combat illusion about the enemy and peace and always keep themselves combat-ready. Our people's army will wipe out the imperialist aggressors with unpredictable strike and mercilessly destroy their bulwark if they dare recklessly attack us, pursuant to their \"policy of strength\". National defence and aid to the army represent a supreme patriotic work. All the people should do their utmost to increase the national defence capacity, considering the military affair as the most important affair of the state. We should strengthen and develop our party into an invincible political weapon to accomplish the army-based revolutionary cause of Juche. All the people should devote themselves to consolidating and developing the socialist system and achieving the prosperity of the DPRK with ardent patriotism. We should become ardent patriots who value the sovereignty and dignity of the country and the nation more than our life by learning from the noble patriotism of the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners. All the party members and other working people should fulfil their duty and obligation as citizens of the dignified DPRK. The officials, the leading members of revolution, should have stronger anti-imperialist fighting spirit, revolutionary spirit and militancy than anyone else. The young people should successfully inherit the heroic fighting sprit and trait the preceding generations displayed in the sacred anti-imperialist and anti-U.S. struggle and thus fulfil the important mission they have assumed before the era as a reserve combat unit of the supreme commander. Our army and people are now fully confident of certain victory and optimistic about the future of the revolution. We will wage a staunch struggle with the indomitable stamina with which we defeated the two imperialisms so as to glorify this year, the 55th anniversary of the DPRK, as a year of great creation and victory in which the spirit of socialist Korea will be strikingly demonstrated. Referring to the great progress made in the struggle for national reunification last year, the editorial says: All the fellow countrymen in the north and the south and abroad dynamically advanced, holding high the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. As a result, there took place dramatic events unprecedented in the history of national division. An atmosphere of reconciliation, unity and reunification ran higher than ever before and exchange and cooperation were boosted between the north and the south. The June 15 North-South Joint Declaration will as always remain a banner our nation should hold high in the movement for national reunification. The stand and attitude toward the declaration is a touchstone that distinguishes between patriotism and treachery. All the fellow countrymen should uphold the declaration as an invariable landmark for national reunification and bring about a decisive turn in the accomplishment of the cause of reunification with the might of the nation's driving force. The success or failure of the movement for national reunification depends on how to preserve and implement the idea of \"By Our Nation Itself\", the basic spirit of the north-south joint declaration. All the fellow countrymen should give further momentum to the movement for national reunification under the uplifted slogan \"Let Us Bring Earlier the Independent Reunification by the Concerted Efforts of Our Nation\". Cooperation between the compatriots is a short cut to reunification. We should place the common interests of the nation above anything else, subordinate everything to them and achieve the great national unity in the idea of national independence and patriotism. The anti-national moves to seek \"cooperation\" with outside forces, blinded by greed for power and comfort should be thoroughly rejected. It is an urgent national task to avert the danger of war and preserve peace on the Korean Peninsula at present. There is neither reason nor condition for the fellow countrymen to strain the situation and disturb peace against the fellow countrymen as the north and the south are heading for reconciliation, unity and reunification. It can be said that there exists on the Korean Peninsula at present only confrontation between the Koreans in the north and the south and the United States. The United States is now becoming all the more frantic in its moves to stifle the DPRK, openly clamoring about a preemptive nuclear attack on it. This is spoiling the atmosphere of reconciliation between the north and the south and posing a grave threat to peace. All the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should approach the reckless and vicious war moves of the U.S. imperialists with high vigilance and deal a telling blow at them by the concerted efforts of the whole nation. The U.S. bellicose elements should clearly know that their strategy to dominate Korea is a pipe-dream, stop the provocative and military pressure and withdraw their aggression forces from South Korea without delay. The great army-based policy is a policy of attaching importance to the nation as it is aimed to defend the sovereignty of the whole nation and a patriotic policy for its common prosperity. Whoever is concerned for the destiny and future of the nation should support and defend the army-based policy and remain true to it with ardent patriotism whether they be in the north and the south and abroad. A very bright prospect is in store for the DPRK that has adorned its flag with great victories only. We are sure to win as long as there are the invincible revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu and the steel-strong single-hearted unity of the party and the people. Under the banner of the great army-based policy our army and people will glorify forever the proud history and traditions of our republic that has always emerged victorious in the confrontation with imperialism. by January 02, 2003",

All the people should do their utmost to increase the national defence capacity, considering the military affair as the most important affair of the state. We should strengthen and develop our party into an invincible political weapon to accomplish the army-based revolutionary cause of Juche. All the people should devote themselves to consolidating and developing the socialist system and achieving the prosperity of the DPRK with ardent patriotism. We should become ardent patriots who value the sovereignty and dignity of the country and the nation more than our life by learning from the noble patriotism of the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners. All the party members and other working people should fulfil their duty and obligation as citizens of the dignified DPRK. The officials, the leading members of revolution, should have stronger anti-imperialist fighting spirit, revolutionary spirit and militancy than anyone else. The young people should successfully inherit the heroic fighting sprit and trait the preceding generations displayed in the sacred anti-imperialist and anti-U.S. struggle and thus fulfil the important mission they have assumed before the era as a reserve combat unit of the supreme commander. Our army and people are now fully confident of certain victory and optimistic about the future of the revolution. We will wage a staunch struggle with the indomitable stamina with which we defeated the two imperialisms so as to glorify this year, the 55th anniversary of the DPRK, as a year of great creation and victory in which the spirit of socialist Korea will be strikingly demonstrated. Referring to the great progress made in the struggle for national reunification last year, the editorial says: All the fellow countrymen in the north and the south and abroad dynamically advanced, holding high the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. As a result, there took place dramatic events unprecedented in the history of national division. An atmosphere of reconciliation, unity and reunification ran higher than ever before and exchange and cooperation were boosted between the north and the south. The June 15 North-South Joint Declaration will as always remain a banner our nation should hold high in the movement for national reunification. The stand and attitude toward the declaration is a touchstone that distinguishes between patriotism and treachery. All the fellow countrymen should uphold the declaration as an invariable landmark for national reunification and bring about a decisive turn in the accomplishment of the cause of reunification with the might of the nation's driving force. The success or failure of the movement for national reunification depends on how to preserve and implement the idea of \"By Our Nation Itself\", the basic spirit of the north-south joint declaration. All the fellow countrymen should give further momentum to the movement for national reunification under the uplifted slogan \"Let Us Bring Earlier the Independent Reunification by the Concerted Efforts of Our Nation\". Cooperation between the compatriots is a short cut to reunification. We should place the common interests of the nation above anything else, subordinate everything to them and achieve the great national unity in the idea of national independence and patriotism. The anti-national moves to seek \"cooperation\" with outside forces, blinded by greed for power and comfort should be thoroughly rejected. It is an urgent national task to avert the danger of war and preserve peace on the Korean Peninsula at present. There is neither reason nor condition for the fellow countrymen to strain the situation and disturb peace against the fellow countrymen as the north and the south are heading for reconciliation, unity and reunification. It can be said that there exists on the Korean Peninsula at present only confrontation between the Koreans in the north and the south and the United States. The United States is now becoming all the more frantic in its moves to stifle the DPRK, openly clamoring about a preemptive nuclear attack on it. This is spoiling the atmosphere of reconciliation between the north and the south and posing a grave threat to peace. All the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should approach the reckless and vicious war moves of the U.S. imperialists with high vigilance and deal a telling blow at them by the concerted efforts of the whole nation. The U.S. bellicose elements should clearly know that their strategy to dominate Korea is a pipe-dream, stop the provocative and military pressure and withdraw their aggression forces from South Korea without delay. The great army-based policy is a policy of attaching importance to the nation as it is aimed to defend the sovereignty of the whole nation and a patriotic policy for its common prosperity. Whoever is concerned for the destiny and future of the nation should support and defend the army-based policy and remain true to it with ardent patriotism whether they be in the north and the south and abroad. A very bright prospect is in store for the DPRK that has adorned its flag with great victories only. We are sure to win as long as there are the invincible revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu and the steel-strong single-hearted unity of the party and the people. Under the banner of the great army-based policy our army and people will glorify forever the proud history and traditions of our republic that has always emerged victorious in the confrontation with imperialism. \n<div class=\"txt_iht_03_2\">\n <b>by <br/>January 02, 2003</b>\n <p style=\"margin-top:2px\"></p>\n</div>",

He said reinforcing the criminal code is not sufficient to guarantee the security of the nation. Last Friday, the governing party decided to abolish the decades-old anti-communist security law and add clauses to the criminal code. Major changes to the code would include a new clause that allows for punishing “organizations intent on rebellion” that “illegally occupy territory of the nation.” That clause is meant to replace the one in the security law targeting “anti-state organizations” that “claim the title of a government.” Many lawyers have said that this change, in effect, would eliminate the longstanding designation of Pyeongyang as an anti-state organization or enemy. The party says it will present the bill to the National Assembly this week. “If the new clause in the code allows punishing only organizations that have an intent of rebellion, that may create much confusion and controversy when prosecutors attempt to apply the revision to the real situation,” Mr. Song said. Asked whether he acknowledged the past human rights abuses committed in the name of the security law, Mr. Song said, “In the past, there were cases that the clauses in the law were applied to unreasonably. But such cases have not taken place since the military regimes ended.” Meanwhile, Uri Party leaders yesterday responded to criticism that under their proposed changes, acts in support of Pyeongyang, and acts by Pyeongyang threatening the security of Seoul, would be unpunishable. “North Korea is a partner in cooperation to achieve unification,” said Chun Jung-bae, the party’s floor leader. “But it still threatens our national security, and thus will be defined as an organization intent on rebellion that attempts to illegally occupy our territory. The revised code will be able to punish North Korea’s acts that threaten the security of South Korea.” by Kim Jung-wook, Min Seong-jae",

          "body_text": "Caves loom large in Korean history. For the Neanderthal man on the peninsula, they are thought to have been the primary shelter. For centuries, Buddhist monks have retreated to grottos for extended periods of solitary meditation. There are about 1,000 known sites, including limestone caves, sea caves and lava caves on Jeju island. Still, many of Korea’s caves were undiscovered until the late 20th century. In Danyang, North Chungcheong province, several now-famous grottos were found in the 1970s. Today, 13 “show caves” in Korea have been embellished with lights, railings and admission fees, but that wasn’t the case 30 years ago. “You can’t describe the early days,” said Um Kyung-seop, 49, one of the early explorers of Gosu cave, located across the Hantan River from Danyang. “Now there are stairs and so forth but [back then] we had to wade through water ― there was nothing.” Though Gosu is the best known of Danyang’s four public caves, the area is home to some 100 caves, though most are off-limits. Mr. Um, who fulfills his exploratory urges with Korea Caving Society teams, still stays close to his beloved Gosu cave. On a recent Sunday, he helped collect tickets as visitors, mostly families and groups, swarmed through the turnstile. If you come to Gosudonggul (donggul means cave in Korean) on a Sunday, you won’t be alone, but don’t judge this cave by its tourist village. Though it may not be in the league of Carlsbad Caverns in the United States or those in Sabah, Malaysia, the geological delights found inside ― stalagmites, flowstones, curtains, soda straws, cave pearls ― still exceed most expectations. Better yet, Gosu and a handful of other caves nearby can all be explored on an overnight or even on a day trip from Seoul and environs. And with a consistently cool temperature of 15 degrees centigrade (59 F), it’s a great place to be on a hot day. To enter Gosu’s chambers, you first ascend a narrow staircase and shortly come upon the first of many impressive formations: the Ten-Thousand-Faced Figure. Here’s where the bottleneck kicks in, as folks stop to gaze and pull out their digital cameras for a snapshot. En route, you come upon dozens more forms, such as Eagle Rock and St. Maria’s Image, that do in fact bear striking resemblance to their namesakes. Others, such as Chanhyeon Palace, may require a brushup on history to figure out. At another turn, a small pool has been filled with coins from wishful visitors. Such an act, Mr. Um said, harms the cave ecosystem and is forbidden. Though no helmets are offered here, taller visitors would be advised to bring one; there are a couple of low spots. At the Fairy’s Garden, you begin a steep descent toward the Hundred Story Pagoda. At the bottom, a man will offer to take your picture for 7,000 won ($6). Flipping a switch, he illuminates a stunning backdrop with powerful beams that bring out the scene in a way that most camera flashes can’t. About 30 minutes in, you get a little vertical as you descend a spiral staircase. You know you’re on the ground floor when you see an immense lighted stalactite and another photographer. About four kilometers (2.5 miles) from Gosu, near a trailhead for Sobaeksan National Park, is Cheondong cave, discovered in 1977. Unlike the arm’s length observations at Gosu, prepare to get intimate with rock here. To reach the entrance, you walk steeply uphill on a wooded path for about five minutes. “Reconsider going in, because it’s extremely difficult,” admonishes a member of a bubbly group that’s just exited. An entrance sign puts it more bluntly: “People with high blood pressure, claustrophobia, heart disease or disc problems are not allowed to enter due to this cave’s many low areas.” If you’re brave, strap on a helmet and plunge inside, but only after removing any brand-name clothes you’re loath to get torn. The crawling starts early in this 300-meter cave, which is basically a vertical drop. At your first breather, you’re rewarded with a view of a “hairy” stalactite, which is supposedly very rare. Further on, some more oddities: a stalagmitic “mushroom” floating in a small puddle, and a bunch of “grapes” that grow about one centimeter per century. Along the way you also encounter the Statue of Headless Venus, the Stone Forest and the Leaning Tower of Pisa. While first-time spelunkers emerge from Cheondong with an Indiana Jones-sized ego, it’s still a show cave, with artificial lighting, steel staircases and lots of protective green fencing. The intrepid souls in the Korea Caving Society have none of these luxuries on their trips, and that’s the way they like it. “You will see the real darkness in these caves,” says An Jung-hwa, a graduate student in zoology who joins these monthly trips. “It’s the same when you close and open your eyes.” Society explorers carry lanterns in addition to headlamps. If you want some solitude, try Nodong, the least-visited of the area’s four public caves (the fourth is Ondal). Set off an isolated stretch of rural blacktop, and challenging to reach without private transport, Nodong is a 1,300-meter-long vertical cave boasting an intricate network of staircases and rails straight out of a Hardy Boys mystery. Just don’t look over the rail. And watch out for low-flying bats. They’ll come circling, squeaking and flapping, without warning. That, with the blue and red lights, can make for a few spooky moments. Yongduam, the Dragon’s Head, greets you toward the end of the long grind up a stairway. At a three-way junction near the Citron, the weary should make an escape by turning left. Those continuing on a 15-minute loop will wend through some tight, slippery and steep sections before being rewarded by the Amelie Bell, the Breast, the Devil and the Tower of Babel. Some may come away from Nodong disappointed at seeing so many broken ’mites and ’tites, the work of vandals. “It used to be that way quite a while ago, but not anymore,” said Woo Kyung-sik, director of the Cave Research Institute at Gangwon National University. “There were several educational programs about it on TV, and some people actually got arrested.” An equally strong deterrent has been the public’s realization that such natural wonders are valuable in luring tourists to the area. Said Mr. Woo: “Local people are beginning to realize that our heritage is very important.” All caves are open from 9 a.m. to 5 or 6 p.m. daily, and cost 4,000 won ($3.50) for adults, 2,500 for youths and 1,500 for children. Discounts are offered for large groups. Call the Danyang tourist office at (043) 422-1146 for more information. English assistance is available. Trains for Danyang depart regularly from Cheongnyangni Station in Seoul (9,000 won and up). Buses leave hourly from the Dong Seoul Bus Station, at Gangbyeon Station on line No. 2, from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Local buses from outside the Danyang bus terminal go to all caves, but only twice daily to Nodong. Several mid-priced motels (30,000 to 40,000 won) line the road along the Hantan River in town, as well as the more upscale Danyang Tourist Hotel and the Daemyung Condo. by Joel Levin",

Today, 13 “show caves” in Korea have been embellished with lights, railings and admission fees, but that wasn’t the case 30 years ago. \n<br/> “You can’t describe the early days,” said Um Kyung-seop, 49, one of the early explorers of Gosu cave, located across the Hantan River from Danyang. “Now there are stairs and so forth but [back then] we had to wade through water ― there was nothing.” \n<br/> Though Gosu is the best known of Danyang’s four public caves, the area is home to some 100 caves, though most are off-limits. \n<br/> Mr. Um, who fulfills his exploratory urges with Korea Caving Society teams, still stays close to his beloved Gosu cave. On a recent Sunday, he helped collect tickets as visitors, mostly families and groups, swarmed through the turnstile.\n<br/> If you come to Gosudonggul (donggul means cave in Korean) on a Sunday, you won’t be alone, but don’t judge this cave by its tourist village. Though it may not be in the league of Carlsbad Caverns in the United States or those in Sabah, Malaysia, the geological delights found inside ― stalagmites, flowstones, curtains, soda straws, cave pearls ― still exceed most expectations. \n<br/> Better yet, Gosu and a handful of other caves nearby can all be explored on an overnight or even on a day trip from Seoul and environs. And with a consistently cool temperature of 15 degrees centigrade (59 F), it’s a great place to be on a hot day.\n<br/> To enter Gosu’s chambers, you first ascend a narrow staircase and shortly come upon the first of many impressive formations: the Ten-Thousand-Faced Figure. Here’s where the bottleneck kicks in, as folks stop to gaze and pull out their digital cameras for a snapshot.\n<br/> En route, you come upon dozens more forms, such as Eagle Rock and St. Maria’s Image, that do in fact bear striking resemblance to their namesakes. Others, such as Chanhyeon Palace, may require a brushup on history to figure out. \n<br/> At another turn, a small pool has been filled with coins from wishful visitors. Such an act, Mr. Um said, harms the cave ecosystem and is forbidden. \n<br/> Though no helmets are offered here, taller visitors would be advised to bring one; there are a couple of low spots.\n<br/> At the Fairy’s Garden, you begin a steep descent toward the Hundred Story Pagoda. At the bottom, a man will offer to take your picture for 7,000 won ($6). Flipping a switch, he illuminates a stunning backdrop with powerful beams that bring out the scene in a way that most camera flashes can’t.\n<br/> About 30 minutes in, you get a little vertical as you descend a spiral staircase. You know you’re on the ground floor when you see an immense lighted stalactite and another photographer.\n<br/> About four kilometers (2.5 miles) from Gosu, near a trailhead for Sobaeksan National Park, is Cheondong cave, discovered in 1977. Unlike the arm’s length observations at Gosu, prepare to get intimate with rock here. \n<br/> To reach the entrance, you walk steeply uphill on a wooded path for about five minutes. “Reconsider going in, because it’s extremely difficult,” admonishes a member of a bubbly group that’s just exited. \n<br/> An entrance sign puts it more bluntly: “People with high blood pressure, claustrophobia, heart disease or disc problems are not allowed to enter due to this cave’s many low areas.” \n<br/> If you’re brave, strap on a helmet and plunge inside, but only after removing any brand-name clothes you’re loath to get torn. The crawling starts early in this 300-meter cave, which is basically a vertical drop. \n<br/> At your first breather, you’re rewarded with a view of a “hairy” stalactite, which is supposedly very rare. Further on, some more oddities: a stalagmitic “mushroom” floating in a small puddle, and a bunch of “grapes” that grow about one centimeter per century. \n<br/> Along the way you also encounter the Statue of Headless Venus, the Stone Forest and the Leaning Tower of Pisa. \n<br/> While first-time spelunkers emerge from Cheondong with an Indiana Jones-sized ego, it’s still a show cave, with artificial lighting, steel staircases and lots of protective green fencing. The intrepid souls in the Korea Caving Society have none of these luxuries on their trips, and that’s the way they like it.\n<br/> “You will see the real darkness in these caves,” says An Jung-hwa, a graduate student in zoology who joins these monthly trips. “It’s the same when you close and open your eyes.” Society explorers carry lanterns in addition to headlamps.\n<br/> If you want some solitude, try Nodong, the least-visited of the area’s four public caves (the fourth is Ondal). Set off an isolated stretch of rural blacktop, and challenging to reach without private transport, Nodong is a 1,300-meter-long vertical cave boasting an intricate network of staircases and rails straight out of a Hardy Boys mystery. Just don’t look over the rail. \n<br/> And watch out for low-flying bats. They’ll come circling, squeaking and flapping, without warning. That, with the blue and red lights, can make for a few spooky moments.\n<br/> Yongduam, the Dragon’s Head, greets you toward the end of the long grind up a stairway. At a three-way junction near the Citron, the weary should make an escape by turning left. \n<br/> Those continuing on a 15-minute loop will wend through some tight, slippery and steep sections before being rewarded by the Amelie Bell, the Breast, the Devil and the Tower of Babel. \n<br/> Some may come away from Nodong disappointed at seeing so many broken ’mites and ’tites, the work of vandals. \n<br/> “It used to be that way quite a while ago, but not anymore,” said Woo Kyung-sik, director of the Cave Research Institute at Gangwon National University. “There were several educational programs about it on TV, and some people actually got arrested.” \n<br/> An equally strong deterrent has been the public’s realization that such natural wonders are valuable in luring tourists to the area. Said Mr. Woo: “Local people are beginning to realize that our heritage is very important.”\n<br/> \n<br/> \n<br/> All caves are open from 9 a.m. to 5 or 6 p.m. daily, and cost 4,000 won ($3.50) for adults, 2,500 for youths and 1,500 for children. Discounts are offered for large groups. Call the Danyang tourist office at (043) 422-1146 for more information. English assistance is available.\n<br/> Trains for Danyang depart regularly from Cheongnyangni Station in Seoul (9,000 won and up). Buses leave hourly from the Dong Seoul Bus Station, at Gangbyeon Station on line No. 2, from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Local buses from outside the Danyang bus terminal go to all caves, but only twice daily to Nodong. \n<br/> Several mid-priced motels (30,000 to 40,000 won) line the road along the Hantan River in town, as well as the more upscale Danyang Tourist Hotel and the Daemyung Condo.\n<br/> \n<br/> \n<br/> by Joel Levin \n<joellevin@hotmail.com></joellevin@hotmail.com>",

A week after the state health authorities confirmed the initial outbreak in Eumseong, North Chungcheong province, signs of infection were reported at poultry farms in South Chungcheong, South Jeolla, North Gyeongsang and Gyeonggi provinces. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry reported yesterday that hundreds of fowl had died from what appeared to be bird flu at a farm in Gyeongju, 184 kilometers southeast from the first infected farm, and at another duck farm in Naju, 220 kilometers southwest of the initial outbreak site. The ministry said the infection was confirmed at five farms in Eumseong and one in Cheonan. Six others are waiting for test results. The ministry also conducted tests at 52 breeding duck farms nationwide. “It appears that additional outbreaks were caused by infected migratory birds,” an agricultural ministry official said. “It’s unlikely the virus traveled from Eumseong to the southern provinces.” The highly contagious disease is not spread through air, but by contact. The virus is thought to be a threat to humans, but no human cases have been reported so far, the National Institute of Health said yesterday. As the outbreak sweeps over the nation, farmers and businessmen suffered from major losses. Fine Korea, the nation’s largest duck processor, went bankrupt last week. The company processed 90,000 ducks and 300,000 chickens on daily average. “Exports were halted since Dec. 11, and domestic consumption plummeted,” Na Won-ju, president of Fine Korea, said. “Daily sales dropped by more than 50 percent since Wednesday, causing a fatal blow to our business.” Supermarket chains nationwide reported more than a 30-percent fall in sales of poultry. The wholesale price of chicken has plunged from 991 won (82 cents) per kilogram on Dec. 10 to 693 won Friday. The government decided yesterday to purchase 2.5 million chickens in order to stop the price from falling any further. by Kim Young-hoon",

Ms. Han, a housewife, got a divorce in February 2003 after she found out that her husband, Dr. Lee, had been cheating on her. But she did not receive any alimony ― the physician, in his 40s, had hidden away all of his property before she filed for divorce. Dr. Lee nominally transferred ownership of apartments valued at 600 million won ($524,000) to his sister, while dispersing his savings to 100 different bank accounts in other people’s names. Judging that he had no property left, the court ordered him only to pay 1 million won in child support every month. Ms. Jung, a 45-year-old housewife, was evicted from her own house recently. Her husband had leased the house to someone else before filing for a divorce in November 2003. “One third of divorce counseling sessions concern spouses who have concealed their assets,” said Lee Myeong-suk, a lawyer. To prevent such problems, some newlyweds are opting to jointly sign the contract when buying a house. But elder couples disapprove of the idea. Divorce courts determine alimony payments based on the assets spouses have when a divorce suit is filed, one reason why so many spouses hide their assets. Experts note that the real-name financial system bars a spouse from checking on another’s assets at a financial organization, while credit companies and pension services also refuse to provide such information. “In the U.S. when a person reports falsely on his property, he ends up giving everything to his spouse,” said Ms. Lee. “There is a need for such strong measures here too.” by Sohn Hae-yong, Lee Min-a",

          "body_text": "Mountain boarding A mountain board looks like a snowboard with four wheels. Unlike a skateboard, it can also be used on grassy mountain slopes. The concept is said to have been invented by American snowboarders in the early 1990s. Wondering how to get their fix during the summer months, they dreamed up the mountain board. Jisan Resort in Icheon, Gyeonggi province, recently began a mountain boarding program that includes board rentals and instructions for beginners. A weekend package, which offers a round-trip bus ticket, a lift pass, board rental, instruction and lunch, is priced at 39,000 won ($34). Reservations for each weekend must be made by Friday. Park golf Park golf, a combination of golf and cricket, is played on what is referred to as a nine-hole course. To score, a player uses a wooden club to tap a plastic ball measuring 6 centimeters (2.4 inches) in diameter through a hole 10 centimeters wide. The rules are simple and the game can be played without knowing how to play golf or cricket. One game takes about an hour. Resorts that offer park golf programs include Phoenix Park in Pyeongchang county, Gangwon province; Yangji Pine Resort in Yongin, Gyeonggi province; and Hanwha Resort on Jeju island. The price per game ranges from 5,000 won to 8,000 won per person. All-terrain vehicles An off-road sport best enjoyed in mountain valleys and hills. Driver’s license not necessary. Yong Pyong Resort in Pyeongchang, Gangwon province, Vivaldi Park in Hongcheon, Gangwon province, Phoenix Park and Yangji Pine Resort all offer all-terrain vehicle rental. Yongpyong has four slopes on Mount Balwang, which stands 1,458 meters (4,783 feet) above sea level. Vivaldi Park operates an 800-meter course with natural and artificial barriers such as hills, cobblestone fields, lumber rails and a valley. Euro bungee jumping Euro bungee jumping combines the trampoline with bungee jumping. An operator remotely controls the length of ropes tied to either side of the bungee jumper’s waist as he or she jumps on the trampoline. An experienced jumper can clear 10 meters. Up to three people can bounce on a single trampoline at the same time. Vivaldi Park, Phoenix Park and Yangji Pine Resort offer Euro bungee jumping; the price ranges from 5,000 won to 8,000 won. Paintball A survival game played with guns that fire balls of paint. Players in special uniforms are divided into two teams, given walkie-talkies and paint guns and instructed to shoot each other. A group 10 or larger can play at one time. Games available at Vivaldi Park and Muju Resort in North Jeolla province. Mountain bobsleigh Like the real thing except the sleigh has wheels and seats only one person. Yongpyong Resort and Yangji Pine Resort have 750-meter- to 850-meter-long courses. Price starts from 4,500 won to 5,000 won per run. by Sung Si-yoon, Limb Jae-un Phoenix Park (02) 508-3400; Muju Resort (063) 322-9000; Yangji Pine Resort (02) 540-6800; Vivaldi Park (033) 434-8311; Jeju Hanwha Resort (064) 725-9000; Yong Pyong Resort (02) 3270-1130.",

The Seoul city government is adding more measures to save energy to the second stage of its conservation efforts, which will be put into effect partially beginning Thursday. Large department stores and shopping centers will be ordered to turn off their outdoor lights after business hours, city officials said yesterday, and gasoline and liquefied petroleum gas stations will be told to turn off their outdoor advertising signs from sunset to sunrise. The steps were taken as a conservation measure to counter higher oil prices that have resulted from tensions in the Middle East. In contrast to the energy conservation program begun by the city government last week, which recommended that some businesses dim their lights, the second phase requires designated businesses to comply. The third stage would require utilities to regulate the supply of electricity. Depending on oil prices, a city official said, the city could implement other second-stage measures like ending the use of space heaters in city buildings and turning off outdoor lighted signs and displays. Movie theaters could also be required to end their midnight screenings, and 24-hour public baths and saunas would have to limit the use of energy from midnight to 4 a.m. Officials in Seoul's eastern Gwangjin district said they are considering plans to turn off half the street lights there and may ask apartment buildings to stop elevator service to their lower floors. by Park Soo-mee",
